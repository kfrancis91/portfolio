Just like she was, I'm <img src=""blank_feeling.png""> too.",
"I'm disabled, and to get through life it takes the right mentality. I feel positive and grateful. Sometimes I'm <img src=""blank_feeling.png"">, but I can't complain since I have the essentials: food, water, shelter, and<img src=""blank_thing.png"">. And thanks to government funding, I get daily visits from <img src=""blank_being.png""> to look after my other needs.",

I'm <img src=""blank_feeling.png"">, but who isn't at this age?<br><br>Just yesterday Martha and I <img src=""blank_action.png""> the other residents down by the lake. Or perhaps that wasn't Martha. I have a vague sense that she passed away last week from cancer. Ah, that's right! She's dead. She left me <img src=""blank_thing.png""> to remember her by.",
"Look, all I know is I woke up in the Brazilian jungle with a head wound and <img src=""blank_thing.png""> in my hand. I have absolutely no clue how I got there.

"I've been <img src=""blank_feeling.png""> ever since I came back from Mexico.

"Wait, you mean to tell me you spent $5000 on <img src=""blank_thing.png"">? Without even <i>asking</i> me if I would agree to this? I don't even know what to say. I'm mad enough to hit you with <img src=""blank_thing.png"">. Because it feels like I'm on my own in this relationship. Honestly, right now I'm wishing I'd married <img src=""blank_being.png"">. They would at least understand what a marriage requires.",

"Holy fucking shit, it's <img src=""blank_being.png"">! In the flesh! I'm <i>such</i> a big fan, you have no idea. This may sound crazy, but I actually have <img src=""blank_thing.png""> next to a bunch of pictures of you in my house, so that whenever I'm <img src=""blank_feeling.png"">, I can sit by my little shrine to you and think about you.

"I failed you, Lucy. I know that now. When your dad choked on <img src=""blank_thing.png"">, I guess I just hadn't prepared for a life without him. I did try, I really did.
